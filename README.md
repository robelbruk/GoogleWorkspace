# GoogleWorkspace
Creating an automation script to replace Google Workspace (new user intros)
When a user is created, they will be given an alias that is modeled such as: firstName.LastName@cmtelematics.com. An email will then be sent to their manager stating that their employee has been created in Google and they are ready to be invited to meetings.
